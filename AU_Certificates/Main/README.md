# Answering Open Data Certificate questions automatically  

The Open Data Certificate questionnaire can read metadata to automatically answer questions, if your data is:

- stored in a [CKAN](http://ckan.org) repository (such as data.qld.gov.au)
- marked up with [DCAT](). [Learn how](http://theodi.org/guides/marking-up-your-dataset-with-dcat)

If your data is stored in a CKAN repository (such as data.gov.uk), or marked up with DCAT, then we will attempt to automatically answer some of the questions for you in the next step. Read more...


Pre-filling questionnaire answers
When you provide a URL to the dataset, the questionnaire uses the metadata to pre-fill answers. Not all questions can be answered with metadata.
