<h1>ODI Open Data Certificates</h1>
<p>15 January 2015</p>

<h2>What is an open data certificate?</h2>

<p>An open data certificate is an indicator of the quality of an open dataset. The criteria to earn a certificate are based on a number of <a href="https://github.com/theodi/open-data-certificate/wiki/Vision" title="Vision for Open Data Certificates on GitHub">global best practices</a> that have been consolidated by the Open Data Institute. </p>

<h2>Why earn a certificate for your open data?</h2>

<p>Earning an open data certificate provides a number of benefits for data re-users, publishers and policy makers, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/246127801/Introduction-to-Open-Data-Certificates" title="ODI training notes on Scridb">Introduction to Open Data Certificates</a>: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Re-users will be informed of: </li>

<ul>
	<li>What they can legally do.</li>
	<li>Whether they can rely on the data. </li>
	<li>What the data means. </li>
	<li>Where to get some support. </li>
</ul>


	<li>Publishers will be provided with: </li>


<ul>
	<li>A simple, semi-automated process to earn certificates.</li>
	<li>A badge to display with their data to indicate its quality.</li>
	<li>Automated suggestions to improve data quality. </li>
</ul>

	<li>Policy makers will have a mechanism to: </li>


<ul>
	<li>Use Open Data Certificates as shorthand for set of standard requirements.</li>
	<li>Set a standard for publishing open data, potentially based on the data’s value. </li>
	<li>Set a standard for the procurement of new systems and data.</li>
	<li>Use as the basis to measure the quantity and quality of open data. </li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>Deloitte, in <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/Data-Matters/2014/11/what-do-businesses-really-look-for-in-open-data.html" title="Harvey Lewis, Deloitte, in Computer Weekly">What do businesses really look for in open data?</a>, supports the use of open data certificates, if businesses are expected to take open data seriously. </p>

<h2>How do you get a certificate?</h2>

<p>To earn a certificate:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Publish your open data.</li>
	<li>Go to the <a href="https://certificates.theodi.org">ODI open data certificate site</a>.</li>
	<li>Create an account and complete the survey about your data.</li>
</ol>

<p>It took me about 15 minutes to earn <a href="https://certificates.theodi.org/datasets/23694/certificate">my first certificate</a>.</p>

<h2>What questions will you be asked?</h2>

<p><a href="https://certificates.theodi.org/overview">See what you’ll be asked</a> before you get started. Questions are asked in four areas:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Legal (rights, licensing, privacy). </li>
	<li>Practical (guarantees, quality). </li>
	<li>Technical (formats, metadata). </li>
	<li>Social (documentation, support). </li>
</ol>

<p>Many questions can be automatically answered by the metadata associated with your data. There are some questions that you’ll need to manually answer, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>do you take a regular offsite backups of the data. </li>
    <li>providing a link to a publication that refers to your data.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What if you can’t answer all the questions?</h2>

<p>You don’t need to answer all the questions to earn a certificate. There are four levels, Raw, Pilot, Standard and Expert which can be progressively earned as you improve the quality of your data. Earning any level of open data certificate is a great achievement. </p>

<h2>Future plans</h2>

<p>ODI HQ are working on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>automatically awarding certificates.</li>
	<li>enabling certificates to be displayed within a number of open data portals.</li>
	<li>assisting open data publishers establish policies to improve the quality of open data through the use of open data certificates.</li>
	<li>moving the initiative from beta into full production.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>

<p>The Open Data Institute Queensland will be running a working group to localise open data certificates for Australia. This will tailor the survey questions, through engagement with the community and regulators, to ensure that the legal rights, privacy and licensing questions match local conditions. </p>
