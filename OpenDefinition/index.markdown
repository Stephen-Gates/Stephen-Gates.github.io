#### This is a draft 
The [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/od/) has three key requirements for a work to be open: an *open license*, *access*, and an *open format*. This page focuses on the **open format**: 
1. quoting the <a href=“#openformat”>open format</a> section from the Open Definition, 
2. exploring it’s <a href=“#intent”>intent</a> and the <a href=“#meaning”>meaning of special words</a>,
3. suggesting <a href=“#improve”>ideas for improvement</a>,
4. providing links to <a href=“#resources”>related resources</a>, and 
5. letting you peek at <a href=“#coming”>what’s coming next</a>.

*Get involved, learn more, and help us improve the Open Definition:*
- *To get started, [join the conversation](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/od-discuss) and suggest improvements on the Open Definition discussion list.*
- *Catch up on [past conversations](https://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/) and see what you’ve missed.*
- *Dive in deep, [add an issue](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues) or a pull request to the Open Definition GitHub repository.*

<h2><a id=“openformat”>The Open Format definition</a></h2>
From the Open Definition version 2.0,
>The *work* **must** be provided in a convenient and modifiable form such that there are no unnecessary technological obstacles to the performance of the licensed rights. Specifically, data should be machine-readable, available in bulk, and provided in an open format (i.e., a format with a freely available published specification which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use) or, at the very least, can be processed with at least one free/libre/open-source software tool.

<h2><a id=“intent”>1. Intent and meaning</a></h2>
The words in the Open Definition have been chosen very carefully. Below we make their intent and meaning explicit.
### The intent
We want to create open knowledge. To help achieve this, work needs to published openly and be useful, usable and used.


- no cost in using
- publish in a convenient format
- publish in bulk (API ≠ convenient)
- machine readable for data
- metadata, discovery, structure, code lists, provenance, …
- defined spec
- many implementations
- collaborative spec development
<h3><a id=“meaning”>Words with special meaning</a></h3> 

**Work** - denotes the item or piece of knowledge being transferred [<a href=“#OD”>OD</a>]. Example of a work include, but are not limited to: data, music, art, images, video, literary compositions, web pages and software. 

**Must**, **Required**, or **Shall** - an absolute requirement  [<a href=“#RFC2119”>RFC2119</a>].

**Must Not** or **Shall Not** - an absolute prohibition [<a href=“#RFC2119”>RFC2119</a>].

**Should** or **Recommended** - there may be valid reasons to ignore this requirement but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course [<a href=“#RFC2119”>RFC2119</a>].

**Should Not** or **Not Recommended** - there may be valid reasons in when the particular behaviour is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behaviour described with this label [<a href=“#RFC2119”>RFC2119</a>].

**May** or **Optional** - an absolute prohibition of the Open Definition [<a href=“#RFC2119”>RFC2119</a>].

**Convenient and modifiable form** - 

**Machine-readable** - 

**Available in bulk** - 

freely available published specification which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use

**Freely available published specification** - 
**No restrictions on use** - 
**Processed** - 
**Free/libre/open-source software tool** - 

<h2><a id=“improve”>2. Improving the Open Format</a></h2>

These improvement ideas mainly come from conversations on the [discussion list](https://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/) and cover:
- Improving the Open Format definition 
- Using the Open Format definition

Got an idea? Help <a href=“#contribute”>make it better</a>.

### Improving the Open Format definition 

The work must be distributed in an open format that is appropriate for its media type to maximise the opportunity for reuse. An open format is one that allows the work to be fully performed or processed with no restriction.

An open format **must**:
- have no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use.
- be machine-readable and able to be fully processed with at least one free/libre/open-source software tool.

An open format *should*:
- be documented so it can be freely implemented by others.
- be defined through a fair, transparent and collaborative process.
- be widely used and accepted as best practice within your discipline or other user communities.
- be lossless and uncompressed so all the original detail is retained.



#### bulk relates to access
1.2 Access
The work must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable one-time reproduction cost, preferably downloadable in bulk via the Internet without charge. Any additional information necessary for license compliance (such as names of contributors required for compliance with attribution requirements) must also accompany the work.



## Using the Open Format definition
### A place to link to 
### A conformant list of Open Formats


<h1><a id=“resources”>3. Resources</a></h1>
## Lists of Open Formats
These resources have not been assessed as being conformant with the Open Definition but we think you'll find them useful:
- [name](link) - description 
- [name](link) - description 

## Even more resources?
Do you have another resource you’d like added here?

- Post your suggestion to the [Open Definition discussion list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/od-discuss).

<h1><a id=“coming”>4. What’s coming next? </a></h1>

The [Open Definition version 2.1](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/blob/master/source/open-definition-2.1-dev.markdown) is being drafted. (Can you <a href=“#contribute”>make it better</a>?)
