<h1>Sample Policy</h1>
<p>Here's a suggested policy to use Open Data Certificates as a mechanism to improve open data. </p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p> statement outlining why the organization is issuing the policy, and what its desired effect or outcome of the policy should be.</p>
<h2>An applicability and scope</h2>
<p>Statement describing who the policy affects and which actions are impacted by the policy. The applicability and scope may expressly exclude certain people, organizations, or actions from the policy requirements. Applicability and scope is used to focus the policy on only the desired targets, and avoid unintended consequences where possible.</p>
<h2>effective date</h2>
<p>indicates when the policy comes into force. Retroactive policies are rare, but can be found.</p>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Which parties and organizations are responsible for carrying out individual policy statements. Many policies may require the establishment of some ongoing function or action. For example, a purchasing policy might specify that a purchasing office be created to process purchase requests, and that this office would be responsible for ongoing actions. Responsibilities often include identification of any relevant oversight and/or governance structures.
<h2>Policy statements</h2>
<p>indicating the specific regulations, requirements, or modifications to organizational behavior that the policy is creating. Policy statements are extremely diverse depending on the organization and intent, and may take almost any form.</p>

<h2>Some policies may contain additional sections</h2>
<p>including:</p>
<ul>Background, indicating any reasons, history, and intent that led to the creation of the policy, which may be listed as motivating factors. This information is often quite valuable when policies must be evaluated or used in ambiguous situations, just as the intent of a law can be useful to a court when deciding a case that involves that law.</ul>
<ul>Definitions, providing clear and unambiguous definitions for terms and concepts found in the policy document.</ul>

<h2>Quality Data</h2>

<ul>
    <li>validate on input</li>
    <li>check with tools (csvlint)</li>
    <li>apply schema to validation and checks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality Metadata</h2>

<ul>
    <li>validated</li>
    <li>discovery</li>
    <li>quality</li>
    <li>provenance</li>
    <li>context</li>
    <li>machine and human readable</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality Publishing</h2>

<ul>
    <li>certificate</li>
    <li>metadata promises kept (currency, contacts, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<ul>
    <li>All Queensland Government open data must be published so that it can attain a self certified Australian ODI Certificate at the Raw level.</li>
    <li>Departments should target to have 50% (increasing over time) of their open datasets attain a self certified Australian ODI Certificate at the Pilot level (by a date - Say in 12 months?)</li>
    <li>All high value* datasets must be published to attain a community certified^ Australian ODI Certificate at the Pilot level.</li>
    <li>All very high value datasets (e.g. Public Transport data, Grants data) should strive attain a community certified^ Australian ODI Certificate at the Standard level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>* High value datasets</h3>

<p>Need to determine what is a high value datasets. Criteria may include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>number of downloads,</li>
    <li>Top 10 position within department datasets,</li>
    <li>number of subscribers,</li>
    <li>community value generated,</li>
    <li>or some other measure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>^ Certificate Verification</h3>

<p>We need to determine if there should be any controls on verification, e.g. certificate cannot be verified by people with email address in same domain (i.e. name@tmr.qld.gov.au should not be able to verify data published by tmr.qld.gov.au).</p>
