<h1>Sample Policy</h1>
<p>Here's a suggested policy to use Open Data Certificates as a mechanism to improve the quality of open data. </p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p id="advisory">Statement outlining why the organization is issuing the policy, and what its desired effect or outcome of the policy should be.</p>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to increase the use open data to create social or economic value.</p>
<p>Open data is more likely be used if it is published with a number of qualities, including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The data is published with an open licence, in an open format. respecting people's privacy and applying apprpriate safeguards.</li>
    <li>The data is published respecting people's privacy and applying appropriate safeguards.</li>
    <li>The data is free.</li>
    <li>The data can be discovered on the internet, and its qualities easily understood by both by people and computers.</li>
    <li>Guarantees are provided about the certainty of ongoing data provision.</li>
    <li>People can contact the publisher to suggest improvements and ask questions.</li>
    <li>The publisher builds a community of people interested in re-using the data.</li>
    <li>explain what your open data is about</li>
    <li>improve quality with other people’s help</li>
    <li>respect people’s privacy and rights</li>
    <li>build communities of interested people</li>
    <li>deliver open data that people can depend upon; certainty of supply, currency</li>

    <li></li>
</ol>

<h2>Applicability and scope</h2>
<p id="advisory">Statement describing who the policy affects and which actions are impacted by the policy. The applicability and scope may expressly exclude certain people, organizations, or actions from the policy requirements. Applicability and scope is used to focus the policy on only the desired targets, and avoid unintended consequences where possible.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all open data publish by the organisation.</p>
<h2>Effective date</h2>
<p id="advisory">Indicates when the policy comes into force. Retroactive policies are rare, but can be found.</p>
<p>The policy takes effect on 1 April 2015. <span id="advisory"> Set the date to allow time to ensure the metadata can be associated with the data. This makes it much easier to earn a  certificate as questions can be automatically answered by the metadata. The metadata should follow an international standard (like DCAT or Dublin Core) to support potential automatic awarding of Open Data Certificates.</span> </p>

<h2>Policy statements</h2>
<p id="advisory">Indicating the specific regulations, requirements, or modifications to organizational behavior that the policy is creating. Policy statements are extremely diverse depending on the organization and intent, and may take almost any form.</p>
<ol>
    <li>All new or updated open data must obtain an Australian <a class="dfn" href="#ODI"><abbr title="Open Data Institute">ODI</abbr></a> <a class="dfn" href="#Certificate">Open Data Certificate</a>. <span id="advisory">I don't care what level or if was automatically generated of manually self certified. If you have a raw certificate, you've ticked alot of boxes.</span></li>
    <li>An image representing the Open Data Certificate level earned by a dataset must be displayed with the dataset's entry in the <a class="dfn" href="#Portal">Open Data Portal</a>.</li>
    <li>A link from the dataset's entry in the organisation's open data portal to the full ODI Open Data Certificate must be provided.<li>
    <li></li>
    <li>By [target date], 50% of new or updated open data must attain a self certified Australian ODI Open Data Certificate at the Pilot level. <span id="advisory">What is the difference between the two levels? What's in it for the publisher and consumer?</span></li>
    <li>Every year after the [target date], the percentage of new or updated open data required to attain a Pilot level certificate will increase by 10%.</li>
    <li>Data identified as high value open data must be published to attain a self certified Australian ODI Open Data Certificate at the Pilot level. Publishers must request registered users to provide community verification of the certificate. <span id="advisory">How do we define high value?</span></li>
    <li>All very high value datasets (e.g. Public Transport data, Grants data) should strive attain a community certified^ Australian ODI Certificate at the Standard level.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p id="advisory">Which parties and organizations are responsible for carrying out individual policy statements. Many policies may require the establishment of some ongoing function or action.

Responsibilities often include identification of any relevant oversight and/or governance structures.</p>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<ul>
    <li>All Queensland Government open data must be published so that it can attain a self certified Australian ODI Certificate at the Raw level.</li>
    <li>Departments should target to have 50% (increasing over time) of their open datasets attain a self certified Australian ODI Certificate at the Pilot level (by a date - Say in 12 months?)</li>

<h3>^ Certificate Verification</h3>

<p>We need to determine if there should be any controls on verification, e.g. certificate cannot be verified by people with email address in same domain (i.e. name@tmr.qld.gov.au should not be able to verify data published by tmr.qld.gov.au).</p>
