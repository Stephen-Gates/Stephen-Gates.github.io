<h1>Sample Policy</h1>
<p>Here's a suggested policy to use Open Data Certificates as a mechanism to improve the quality of open data. </p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p id="advisory">Statement outlining why the organization is issuing the policy, and what its desired effect or outcome of the policy should be.</p>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to improve the quality of open data to increase the likelihood of it being used to create social or economic value.</p>
<h2>An applicability and scope</h2>
<p id="advisory">Statement describing who the policy affects and which actions are impacted by the policy. The applicability and scope may expressly exclude certain people, organizations, or actions from the policy requirements. Applicability and scope is used to focus the policy on only the desired targets, and avoid unintended consequences where possible.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all open data publish by the organisation.</p>
<h2>Effective date</h2>
<p id="advisory">Indicates when the policy comes into force. Retroactive policies are rare, but can be found.</p>
<p>The policy takes effect on 1 April 2015.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p id="advisory">Which parties and organizations are responsible for carrying out individual policy statements. Many policies may require the establishment of some ongoing function or action. For example, a purchasing policy might specify that a purchasing office be created to process purchase requests, and that this office would be responsible for ongoing actions. Responsibilities often include identification of any relevant oversight and/or governance structures.</p>

<h2>Policy statements</h2>
<p id="advisory">Indicating the specific regulations, requirements, or modifications to organizational behavior that the policy is creating. Policy statements are extremely diverse depending on the organization and intent, and may take almost any form.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Within six months of the effective date, all new or updated open data must obtain an Australian, self certified, ODI Open Data Certificate at the Raw level. <span id="advisory">This gives you six months to fix your metadata, portal configuration and ideally automate awarding of raw level certificates using only published metadata.</span></li>
    <li>By [target date], 50% of new or updated open data must attain a self certified Australian ODI Open Data Certificate at the Pilot level. <span id="advisory">What is the difference between the two levels? What's in it for the publisher and consumer?</span></li>
    <li>Every year after the [target date], the percentage of new or updated open data required to attain a Pilot level certificate will increase by 10%.</li>
    <li>Data identified as high value open data must be published to attain a self certified Australian ODI Open Data Certificate at the Pilot level. Publishers must request registered users to provide community verification of the certificate. <span id="advisory">How do we define high value?</span></li>
    <li>All very high value datasets (e.g. Public Transport data, Grants data) should strive attain a community certified^ Australian ODI Certificate at the Standard level.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Some policies may contain additional sections</h2>
<p id="advisory">Background, indicating any reasons, history, and intent that led to the creation of the policy, which may be listed as motivating factors. Definitions, providing clear and unambiguous definitions for terms and concepts found in the policy document.</p>

<h2>Quality Data</h2>

<ul>
    <li>validate on input</li>
    <li>check with tools (csvlint)</li>
    <li>apply schema to validation and checks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality Metadata</h2>

<ul>
    <li>validated</li>
    <li>discovery</li>
    <li>quality</li>
    <li>provenance</li>
    <li>context</li>
    <li>machine and human readable</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality Publishing</h2>

<ul>
    <li>certificate</li>
    <li>metadata promises kept (currency, contacts, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<ul>
    <li>All Queensland Government open data must be published so that it can attain a self certified Australian ODI Certificate at the Raw level.</li>
    <li>Departments should target to have 50% (increasing over time) of their open datasets attain a self certified Australian ODI Certificate at the Pilot level (by a date - Say in 12 months?)</li>
    <li>All high value* datasets must be published to attain a community certified^ Australian ODI Certificate at the Pilot level.</li>
    <li>All very high value datasets (e.g. Public Transport data, Grants data) should strive attain a community certified^ Australian ODI Certificate at the Standard level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>* High value datasets</h3>

<p>Need to determine what is a high value datasets. Criteria may include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>number of downloads,</li>
    <li>Top 10 position within department datasets,</li>
    <li>number of subscribers,</li>
    <li>community value generated,</li>
    <li>or some other measure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>^ Certificate Verification</h3>

<p>We need to determine if there should be any controls on verification, e.g. certificate cannot be verified by people with email address in same domain (i.e. name@tmr.qld.gov.au should not be able to verify data published by tmr.qld.gov.au).</p>
