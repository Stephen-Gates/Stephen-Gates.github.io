  "description": "This dataset contains average counts of bicycle traffic by hour of the day and day of the week.\n\nData is collected from bicycle counters across 14 active transport sites. As more sites come on line in the future these will be added to the dataset. These bicycle counters were installed in conjunction with the State Cycle Unit and are permanent installations that provide 24/7 bicycle counting data.",
