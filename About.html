<h2>What is the Australia’s Open Data City Census?</h2>

<p>The Australian Open Data City Census is a crowd-sourced measure of the openness of 10 key <a href="" title="coming soon">datasets</a> based on the answers to 10 <a href="" title="coming soon">questions</a>. Each city, or more correctly <a href="" title="coming soon">each local government</a>, that publishes open data can participate and have their data assessed. Any community member can submit an assessment and a small expert team reviews submissions.</p>

<ul>
<li>encourages publishers of open data to improve how their data is published.</li>
<li>demonstrates improvements made each year.</li>
<li>helps re-users of open data understand any challenges they may encounter. </li>
</ul>
